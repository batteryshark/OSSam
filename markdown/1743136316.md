## üîí Security Assessment
### Vulnerabilities
No known vulnerabilities found.

### Security Advisories

#### Off-by-One Heap Overflow in REGISTER message processing - High
- **Description**: A specially crafted REGISTER message with a malformed `branch` or `From tag` triggers an off-by-one heap overflow. Abuse of this vulnerability leads to denial of service in Kamailio. Further research may show that exploitation leads to remote code execution.
- **Affected Versions**: 5.1.1, 5.1.0, 5.0.0
- **Remediation**: Apply the patch or update to a release that includes the patch (e.g. v5.1.2, v5.0.6 or v4.4.7).

#### Remote Code Execution via Kamailio's exec module - Critical
- **Description**: The combination of pseudo-variables and Kamailio's `exec` module can be risky and may result in code injection. By using special SIP headers and environment variables, it becomes effortless to exploit a vulnerable configuration. A remote attacker may trigger this vulnerability by simply sending a malicious SIP message.
- **Affected Versions**: All versions using the exec module with user-controlled pseudo-variables
- **Remediation**: Avoid the `exec` module altogether or use strict input validation on user-controlled values. Review Kamailio configuration files and determine if and how functions from the `exec` module are used.

#### Insecure Configuration: Default Passwords and Open Ports - Medium
- **Description**: Using default passwords and leaving unnecessary ports open can lead to security breaches. Attackers can exploit these vulnerabilities to gain unauthorized access.
- **Affected Versions**: All versions with default configurations
- **Remediation**: Change default passwords for all Kamailio accounts. Limit accessibility to the Kamailio server to only those who require admin access. Close all unnecessary ports.

#### Importance of regular updates and monitoring - Medium
- **Description**: Failing to update Kamailio can leave you vulnerable to exploits. In addition, ignoring Kamailio server activity could give malicious users access. 
- **Affected Versions**: All versions
- **Remediation**: Always update your software used for running Kamailio. Pay attention to the activity of your Kamailio server, looking for strange traffic patterns or unauthorized access attempts.

#### Security by Obscurity and Topology Hiding - Low
- **Description**: Obscuring network insecurities can deter malicious actors. The `topoh` module helps hide details, such as PSTN gateway addresses and internal network topology, protecting against attacks aimed at exploiting this information.
- **Affected Versions**: All Versions
- **Remediation**: Utilize the `topoh` module to protect addresses of PSTN gateways and hide internal network topology.

## 🔒 Security Assessment
### Vulnerabilities

#### CVE-2013-2139 - Medium
- **Description**: A buffer overflow vulnerability exists in srtp.c in libsrtp in srtp versions 1.4.5 and earlier. This vulnerability allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (crash) via vectors related to a length inconsistency in the crypto_policy_set_from_profile_for_rtp and srtp_protect functions.
- **Status**: Fixed
- **Fixed in**: Likely fixed in a later version than 1.4.5, but the exact version is not specified. Please check the changelogs after version 1.4.5.
- **Attack Vector**: Remote

### Security Advisories

#### Multiple Cisco Products libSRTP Denial of Service Vulnerability - High
- **Description**: Improper input validation of SRTP packets in the encryption processing subsystem of libSRTP could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to trigger a DoS condition by sending a crafted SRTP packet to an affected device.
- **Affected Versions**: Affected Cisco products use a vulnerable version of libSRTP prior to 1.5.3.
- **Remediation**: Apply the relevant patch or workaround referenced in Cisco Security Advisory cisco-sa-20160420-libsrtp. Upgrade to libSRTP version 1.5.3 or later.

#### SRTP Security Best Practices - Medium
- **Description**: Failing to implement proper DTLS key exchange protocols or neglecting to update SRTP configurations with the latest security standards can compromise the integrity of the encrypted data streams. Ensure secure signaling channels and maintain updated encryption standards.
- **Affected Versions**: All versions
- **Remediation**: Adhere to WebRTC security best practices, ensuring secure signaling channels, maintaining updated encryption standards, and leveraging the inherent strengths of SRTP and DTLS. Regularly review and update SRTP configurations with the latest security standards.

#### Huawei EulerOS: Security Advisory for libsrtp (EulerOS-SA-2020-1787) - Medium
- **Description**: The remote host is missing an update for the Huawei EulerOS 'libsrtp' package(s) announced via the EulerOS-SA-2020-1787 advisory.
- **Affected Versions**: All versions
- **Remediation**: Update the Huawei EulerOS 'libsrtp' package(s) according to the EulerOS-SA-2020-1787 advisory.

#### No specific GHSA found for libsrtp v2.6.0 - Low
- **Description**: No official GitHub Security Advisories (GHSA) were found for the libsrtp v2.6.0 package in the specified sources. However, security-related information may exist in issues, pull requests, or other vulnerability databases.
- **Affected Versions**: v2.6.0
- **Remediation**: Check the official libsrtp repository for any security-related patches or updates. Consider upgrading to the latest version of libsrtp to benefit from the latest security fixes.

## 🏥 Health Assessment

### Maintenance Status
- **Status**: Active
- **Last Activity**: 2025-03-10
- **Activity Frequency**: Frequent
- **Open Issues**: 25

### Community Health
- **Contributors**: 81
- **Contribution Diversity**: Good
- **Bus Factor**: Likely > 2
- **Activity Level**: Moderate

### Documentation
- **Quality**: The quality seems good, especially the API documentation within the header files. The information is technically accurate, but accessibility could be improved with a consolidated user guide.
- **Completeness**: The documentation appears to be reasonably complete, with API documentation in the header files and additional documentation in the /doc/ folder of the GitHub repository. However, a single, comprehensive user guide is lacking.

### Security Advisories

#### Default DTLS Certificate and Private Key - High
- **Description**: The Janus server is configured using a certificate and private key that were previously distributed by default. This certificate is used to authenticate the DTLS connection which is later used to exchange keys for the SRTP stream. An attacker can perform a man-in-the-middle attack to hijack the DTLS connection and set their own SRTP keys, handling the SRTP stream instead of the legitimate endpoint.
- **Affected Versions**: All versions using the default certificate.
- **Remediation**: Replace the default DTLS certificate and private key with your own unique, securely generated credentials.

#### Security Misconfiguration - Unprotected Admin Dashboard - Medium
- **Description**: Leaving the Janus admin dashboard open in production can be a security risk. The admin dashboard can be a useful tool for monitoring your Janus gateway, but could be exploited if left unprotected.
- **Affected Versions**: All versions
- **Remediation**: Secure the admin dashboard by setting a location block in your NGINX configuration to maintain HTTPS connections for the admin dashboard.

#### Basic TLS Configuration - Medium
- **Description**: The first step to securing any web server or gateway is ensuring that the client and server can establish a tunneled connection. Janus is no different. We recommend setting up a reverse proxy with NGINX to sit in front of your Janus gateway.
- **Affected Versions**: All versions
- **Remediation**: Set up a reverse proxy with NGINX to sit in front of your Janus gateway. Use Let's Encrypt on Ubuntu 20.04 and set up a free TLS certificate.

#### CoTURN Configuration - Medium
- **Description**: TURN is an essential part of hosting a reliable WebRTC application. Janus can establish a connection through TURN, but it's not very clearly defined how that process works.
- **Affected Versions**: All versions
- **Remediation**: Janus and Janus clients can connect to CoTURN STUN/TURN servers with limited-time tokens so you don't have to share a static user/password credential with the client. Using Janus with CoTURN ephemeral token authentication has a few requirements to get working properly.

- **Notes**: Error while researching license. Please review the license information manually.

## 🔒 Security Assessment
### Vulnerabilities

#### CVE-2020-7105 - Medium
- **Description**: async.c and dict.c in libhiredis.a in hiredis through 0.14.0 allow a NULL pointer dereference because malloc return values are unchecked.
- **Status**: Fixed
- **Fixed in**: 0.14.1
- **Attack Vector**: Network

#### CVE-2021-32762 - High
- **Description**: An integer overflow issue leading to heap buffer overflow was found in the hiredis library. The 'redis-cli' command-line tool and 'redis-sentinel' service may be vulnerable to this flaw when parsing specially crafted, large multi-bulk network replies. This flaw allows a remote attacker to corrupt the heap and potentially trigger remote code execution.
- **Status**: Fixed
- **Fixed in**: 1.0.1
- **Attack Vector**: Remote

#### CVE-2021-32765 - High
- **Description**: Hiredis is vulnerable to integer overflow if provided maliciously crafted or corrupted `RESP` `mult-bulk` protocol data. When parsing `multi-bulk` (array-like) replies, hiredis fails to check if `count * sizeof(redisReply*)` can be represented in `SIZE_MAX`. If it cannot, and the `calloc()` call doesn't itself make this check, it would result in a short allocation and subsequent buffer overflow.
- **Status**: Fixed
- **Fixed in**: 1.0.2
- **Attack Vector**: Network

### Security Advisories

#### Integer overflow in hiredis allows heap overflow - High
- **Description**: Hiredis is a minimalistic C client library for the Redis database. In affected versions Hiredis is vulnurable to integer overflow if provided maliciously crafted or corrupted `RESP` `mult-bulk` protocol data. When parsing `multi-bulk` (array-like) replies, hiredis fails to check if `count * sizeof(redisReply*)` can be represented in `SIZE_MAX`. If it can not, and the `calloc()` call doesn't itself make this check, it would result in a short allocation and subsequent buffer overflow.
- **Affected Versions**: <1.0.1
- **Remediation**: Upgrade to version 1.0.1 or later.

#### Potential Memory Leak in Asynchronous Command Handling - Low
- **Description**: A possible memory leak exists when an asynchronous cluster command fails to send. This can occur during client shutdown or other error conditions.
- **Affected Versions**: 0.14.0
- **Remediation**: This issue was fixed in later versions. Upgrade to a more recent version of the hiredis-cluster package.

#### Denial of Service Vulnerability Due to Unchecked RESP Data - Medium
- **Description**: The hiredis library is vulnerable to denial of service due to an integer overflow vulnerability when parsing RESP multi-bulk data. An attacker can trigger this vulnerability by sending a maliciously crafted or corrupted RESP payload to the Redis server, potentially leading to a short allocation and subsequent buffer overflow.
- **Affected Versions**: 0.14.0
- **Remediation**: Upgrade to a patched version of hiredis that includes the fix for the integer overflow vulnerability.

## 🏥 Health Assessment

### Maintenance Status
- **Status**: Active
- **Last Activity**: 2025-03-24
- **Activity Frequency**: Frequent
- **Open Issues**: 19

### Community Health
- **Contributors**: 17
- **Contribution Diversity**: Moderate
- **Bus Factor**: Likely > 2
- **Activity Level**: Moderate

### Documentation
- **Quality**: The quality of documentation varies. The GitHub README and source code are generally reliable, but lack high-level explanations. External tutorials might be outdated or not specific to hiredis-cluster.
- **Completeness**: The documentation is fragmented, with no single comprehensive resource. Information is spread across the hiredis and hiredis-cluster repositories, making it difficult to get a complete picture.
- **Examples Available**: Yes

## 📈 Overall Assessment
- **Health Score**: 75/100
- **Key Strengths**: Active maintenance and frequent updates, Community engagement and contributions, Ericsson sponsorship, Improved features over hiredis-vip
- **Key Risks**: Potential security vulnerabilities (e.g., integer overflows), Fragmented documentation, Limited roadmap and reliance on maintainers
- **Summary**: The hiredis-cluster project is a moderately healthy C client library for Redis Cluster, actively maintained and sponsored by Ericsson. It shows a good level of community engagement and recent activity. The library benefits from being a fork of hiredis-vip, incorporating improvements like SSL/TLS and IPv6 support. However, the documentation is fragmented, and there are potential security vulnerabilities that need attention. The limited roadmap and reliance on maintainers pose some risks to its long-term sustainability.

## 🔮 Future Outlook
- **Outlook**: Neutral
- **Roadmap Available**: Yes
- **Key Opportunities**: Integration with various event loop systems., Further development of a higher-level API., Address existing issues and feature requests on GitHub
- **Key Risks**: Potential security vulnerabilities, such as integer overflows., Need for careful error handling and boundary checks., Limited roadmap and reliance on maintainers for continued support.

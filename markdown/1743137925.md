## 🔒 Security Assessment
### Vulnerabilities

#### CVE-2020-36325 - Medium
- **Description**: An issue was discovered in Jansson through 2.13.1. Due to a parsing error in json_loads, there's an out-of-bounds read-access bug. NOTE: the vendor reports that this only occurs when a programmer fails to follow the API specification.
- **Status**: Disputed
- **Fixed in**: Unknown
- **Attack Vector**: Remote

### Security Advisories

#### Denial of Service via Recursion Depth - High
- **Description**: Jansson does not limit the recursion depth when parsing JSON arrays and objects, potentially leading to a denial-of-service (DoS) attack via stack exhaustion using crafted JSON data.
- **Affected Versions**: All versions prior to fix
- **Remediation**: Apply patches that limit recursion depth when parsing JSON data.

#### Insecure handling of NaN and Inf values - Low
- **Description**: Jansson versions before a certain fix do not properly check for NaN (Not a Number) and Inf (Infinity) values when parsing JSON reals. Encoding these values results in invalid JSON.
- **Affected Versions**: All versions prior to fix
- **Remediation**: Upgrade to a version where NaN and Inf values are checked for and rejected.

#### Security Best Practices: Input Validation - Medium
- **Description**: Always validate JSON input against an expected schema.  Jansson provides functions for manipulating JSON data, but it is the responsibility of the application developer to ensure that the structure and content of the JSON data conform to what is expected. Failure to do so can lead to unexpected behavior, denial-of-service, or other security vulnerabilities.
- **Affected Versions**: All versions
- **Remediation**: Implement robust input validation to ensure that JSON data conforms to the expected schema. Use schema validation libraries if necessary.

#### Security Best Practices: Secure Memory Handling - Medium
- **Description**: Ensure proper memory management when working with Jansson. Use `json_decref()` to decrement the reference count of JSON objects when they are no longer needed to avoid memory leaks. Be careful when using `json_deep_copy()` to avoid infinite loops with circular references.
- **Affected Versions**: All versions
- **Remediation**: Follow secure memory handling practices by properly decrementing reference counts and avoiding circular references when copying objects.

#### Configuration: Locale Thread Safety - Low
- **Description**: Jansson 2.14.1 addresses thread safety issues related to locale switching using `uselocale` or `newlocale`. Improper locale handling in multithreaded applications can lead to unpredictable behavior.
- **Affected Versions**: 2.14.1
- **Remediation**: Ensure proper synchronization mechanisms are in place when using locales in multithreaded applications.  If using an older version, upgrade to 2.14.1 or later and carefully review locale handling code.

#### Uncontrolled Recursion Depth - High
- **Description**: Jansson does not limit the recursion depth when parsing JSON arrays and objects. This can allow remote attackers to cause a denial of service (crash) via stack exhaustion, using crafted JSON data.
- **Affected Versions**: All versions prior to fix
- **Remediation**: Upgrade to a patched version

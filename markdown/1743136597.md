# Software Package Evaluation Report

## üì¶ Package Information
- **Name**: hiredis
- **Version**: 1.2.0
- **Primary Language**: C
- **Description**: hiredis is a minimalistic C client library for the Redis database. It provides minimal support for the Redis protocol with a high-level printf-like API. It includes a decoupled reply parser suitable for use in higher-level language bindings.
- **Source Code**: https://github.com/redis/hiredis
- **Documentation**: https://github.com/redis/hiredis/blob/master/README.md

## üìä Overall Assessment
- **Guidance**: Generally Safe
- **Explanation**: This is a sample explanation.
- **Health Score**: 75/100

## üìú License Information
- **License**: Unknown
- **Status**: Requires Legal Approval
- **Notes**: Error while researching license. Please review the license information manually.

## üîí Security Assessment
### Vulnerabilities
No known vulnerabilities found.

### Security Advisories

#### Integer Overflow to Buffer Overflow in hiredis - High
- **Description**: Hiredis is vulnerable to integer overflow if provided maliciously crafted or corrupted RESP mult-bulk protocol data. When parsing multi-bulk (array-like) replies, hiredis fails to check if `count * sizeof(redisReply*)` can be represented in `SIZE_MAX`. If it cannot, and the `calloc()` call doesn't itself make this check, it would result in a short allocation and subsequent buffer overflow.
- **Affected Versions**: All versions prior to the fix
- **Remediation**: Users of hiredis who are unable to update may set the `maxelements` context option to a value small enough that no overflow is possible. Upgrade to a patched version (>=1.0.1).

#### Insecure Defaults and Lack of Encryption - Medium
- **Description**: Hiredis, by default, does not enforce encrypted communication. Data transmitted in plain text can be intercepted and read. Redis default configuration binds Redis to all network interfaces, making it accessible over the internet and lacks authentication.
- **Affected Versions**: All versions
- **Remediation**: Enable TLS support (available since Redis 6.0). Use stunnel to secure the connection. Configure Redis to listen on a specific network interface, not all interfaces.  Set up strong authentication using the `requirepass` directive or Access Control Lists (ACLs).

#### Unchecked malloc return values can lead to NULL pointer dereference - Medium
- **Description**: async.c and dict.c in libhiredis.a in hiredis through 0.14.0 allow a NULL pointer dereference because malloc return values are unchecked.
- **Affected Versions**: Versions through 0.14.0
- **Remediation**: Ensure malloc return values are checked

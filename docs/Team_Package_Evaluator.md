# Team Design for Package Evaluator

## Description
The Package Evaluator is a coordinated team of AI agents that performs comprehensive assessments of third-party software packages. This team orchestrates multiple specialized agents to gather and analyze information about packages, evaluate their security posture, assess license compliance, and provide an overall verdict on the suitability of the package for use in production environments. The team produces detailed reports with actionable insights to help developers and organizations make informed decisions about incorporating third-party dependencies into their projects.

## Input
The team accepts a variety of inputs to initiate the evaluation process:

- Package name (required)
- Package version (optional)
- Repository URLs (optional)
- Any additional context about the package (optional)

The minimal required input is just the package name - the team will research and evaluate all other aspects of the package.

## Output
The team produces a comprehensive structured report containing:

* **Package Information**: Basic details about the package, including name, version, description, primary language, and maintainer information.

* **Security Assessment**: Detailed analysis of security considerations including:
  - Risk rating (Low, Medium, High, Critical)
  - Known vulnerabilities (CVEs) with severity assessments
  - Repository health and maintenance status
  - Specific security concerns and recommendations

* **License Evaluation**: Assessment of the package's license including:
  - License type identification
  - Compliance status (Allowed, See Notes, Requires Legal Approval, Not Allowed)
  - Special considerations or restrictions
  - Legal guidance for use

* **Overall Verdict**: A final assessment on whether the package is suitable for use, taking into account all factors:
  - Combined risk level
  - Key considerations for implementation
  - Recommendations for risk mitigation
  - Alternative packages when applicable

* **References**: Collection of all sources and URLs used during the evaluation process.

## Team Composition and Workflow

* **Package Researcher**: Responsible for gathering basic information about the package, including versions, language, description, and repository links.

* **Security Researcher**: Analyzes the package for security vulnerabilities, examines repository health, and assesses overall security risk.

* **License Researcher**: Identifies and evaluates the package's license to determine legal compliance and usage restrictions.

* **Package Evaluator**: Coordinates the entire workflow, orchestrating the specialized agents and synthesizing their findings into a comprehensive assessment and report.

## Tools

* **Agent Coordination Framework** - Utilizes smolagents to manage the multi-agent workflow, ensuring proper sequencing of research and evaluation activities.

* **Package Information Evaluation** - Assesses the basic package information to identify potential issues or concerns related to the package's source, maintenance, and general reputation.

* **License Evaluation** - Analyzes the identified license against organizational policies to determine legal compliance and any restrictions or special considerations.

* **Security Evaluation** - Processes security information including CVEs and repository health to determine the overall security risk level of the package.

* **Verdict Determination** - Synthesizes all gathered information to produce a final recommendation regarding the package's suitability for use.

* **Report Generation** - Creates detailed, structured Markdown reports containing all evaluation findings, with proper formatting and organization for easy consumption.

* **Caching and Persistence** - Saves evaluation results for future reference and quick retrieval of previously evaluated packages.

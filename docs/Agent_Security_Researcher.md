# Agent Design for Security Researcher

## Description
The Security Researcher is an AI agent that evaluates the security posture of third-party software packages. It analyzes package information to identify potential vulnerabilities, security risks, and assess the overall health of the project's maintenance. The agent connects to vulnerability databases, examines repository activity, and applies risk assessment methodologies to provide a comprehensive security evaluation. This helps organizations make informed decisions about the security implications of incorporating third-party software into their projects.

## Input
The agent takes a dictionary of package information as input, typically the output from the Package Researcher agent. This includes:
- Package name
- Package version
- Repository URLs
- Owner/maintainer information
- Other metadata about the package

The agent uses this information as a starting point for security analysis.

## Output
The agent produces a structured output containing comprehensive security evaluation:

* **Security Assessment**: A high-level summary of the security evaluation.
* **Risk Rating**: An overall risk rating categorized as:
    - **Low Risk**: Well-maintained package with few or no known vulnerabilities.
    - **Medium Risk**: Package with some vulnerabilities or maintenance concerns that should be addressed.
    - **High Risk**: Package with critical vulnerabilities or significant maintenance issues that require immediate attention.
    - **Critical Risk**: Package with severe security issues that make it unsuitable for use without remediation.
* **Known Vulnerabilities**: List of identified CVEs (Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures) and their details:
    - CVE IDs
    - Severity ratings
    - Descriptions
    - Impact assessment
    - Remediation status
* **Repository Health**: Assessment of the package's repository maintenance:
    - Project age and activity
    - Frequency of updates
    - Number of contributors
    - Issue and pull request responsiveness
* **Identified Concerns**: Specific security concerns that were identified during analysis.
* **Recommendations**: Actionable advice for mitigating identified security risks.
* **References**: URLs and sources used during the security assessment.

## Tools

* **CVE Search** - Searches the National Vulnerability Database (NVD) for known vulnerabilities associated with the package. It uses the package name and version to find relevant CVEs and extracts severity information, descriptions, and references.

* **Repository Health Analysis** - Evaluates the activity and maintenance of the package's repository. It examines factors such as creation date, contributor count, recent commits, and responsiveness to issues and pull requests.

* **CVE Detail Lookup** - Retrieves comprehensive information about specific CVEs, including detailed descriptions, affected versions, CVSS scores, and remediation guidance.

* **Risk Assessment Calculator** - Processes multiple security factors to calculate an overall risk rating for the package. It considers vulnerability counts, severity levels, repository health metrics, and other security indicators to determine the risk level.

* **Web Search** - Supplements database searches with broader web searches for security information, bug reports, and security discussions related to the package that may not be formally documented in vulnerability databases.

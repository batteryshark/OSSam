*Generated on: 2025-03-08 18:02:21*


## üì¶ Package Information

- **Name:** E2B Secure Open Source Cloud Runtime
- **Requested Version:** current
- **Latest Version:** 1.0.4
- **Primary Language:** TypeScript, Python, JavaScript, Go
- **Description:** E2B is an open-source infrastructure that allows you to run AI-generated code in secure, isolated cloud sandboxes. It provides a secure runtime environment for AI applications and agents, allowing them to use the same tools as humans in a secure cloud environment.
- **Repository:** [https://github.com/e2b-dev/e2b](https://github.com/e2b-dev/e2b)
- **Maintained By:** e2b-dev

## üóíÔ∏è Package Evaluation

- **Advisory:** ‚ùó Use with Caution
- **Explanation:** This package can be used with caution, but be aware of the following risks: Contains known vulnerabilities that may need mitigation, Has medium security risk that requires attention, Has reported security issues that need to be addressed and Using an older version (current) instead of the latest (1.0.4). The implementation risk rating is Medium due to the presence of a high severity CVE (CVE-2023-6932) and potential security vulnerabilities associated with LLM-integrated frameworks, such as RCE, untrusted code execution, and prompt injection attacks. While E2B focuses on providing secure code execution environments, these vulnerabilities and issues need to be carefully considered and mitigated. The repository's relatively young age and the lack of an explicitly stated number of contributors also contribute to the Medium risk rating. License (MIT) is permitted for use.

## üìú License Evaluation

- **License:** MIT
- **Status:** ‚úÖ Allowed
- **Notes:** The MIT License is permissive and business-friendly. It allows for commercial use, modification, distribution, and private use, with minimal restrictions.

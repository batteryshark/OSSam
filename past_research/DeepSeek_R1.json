  "Explanation": "DeepSeek-R1 exhibits several critical security vulnerabilities, including susceptibility to jailbreak attacks, prompt injection, and the generation of harmful content. Additionally, data privacy concerns related to data transmission to China and potential vulnerabilities in the DeepSeek AI app elevate the risk. The combination of these factors warrants a High-risk rating. License (MIT License) is permitted for use.",

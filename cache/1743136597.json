        "severity": "High",
        "description": "Hiredis is vulnerable to integer overflow if provided maliciously crafted or corrupted RESP mult-bulk protocol data. When parsing multi-bulk (array-like) replies, hiredis fails to check if `count * sizeof(redisReply*)` can be represented in `SIZE_MAX`. If it cannot, and the `calloc()` call doesn't itself make this check, it would result in a short allocation and subsequent buffer overflow.",

        "remediation": "Users of hiredis who are unable to update may set the `maxelements` context option to a value small enough that no overflow is possible. Upgrade to a patched version (>=1.0.1).",

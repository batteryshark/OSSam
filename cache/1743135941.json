    "Description": "Libnice is an implementation of the IETF's Interactive Connectivity Establishment (ICE) standard (RFC 5245 & RFC 8445) and the Session Traversal Utilities for NAT (STUN) standard (RFC 5389). It provides a GLib-based library, libnice, as well as GStreamer elements to use it. ICE is useful for applications that want to establish peer-to-peer UDP data streams. It automates the process of traversing NATs and provides security against some attacks. It also allows applications to create reliable streams using a TCP over UDP layer.",
